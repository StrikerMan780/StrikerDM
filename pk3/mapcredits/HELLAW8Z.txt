_______________________________________________________________________________


Description 	: I just started building one time with the idea of wasting as much
		  sectors as possible wich gave some cool results I think. After that
		  I continued building on it when I felt like it. The resultz are this
     		  dm map with 666 sectors. :P
		  It's my first dm map evah so probably the gameplay will suck :)

Story:		You are mister K.Ill, in normal life just the average officeworker at the
		We Store Your Crap company who spends more time at the burger king then at home,
                and a true workaholic.
		But this is about to change when you got transferred to one of the WSYC bases
		on the other side of the world. This base stands on a rocky Island in the middle
		of the pacific oceam about 200 meter above sea level. 
		Something they didn't tell was that the workers there went berserk and are 
		terrorising the factory, killing each other and shooting at everything that moves.
	        The reason of these sudden events still remains unknown.
		They also didn't tell you that you got miniature sensors and camera's with you
		who will register everything happening as soon as you enter the base, hoping
		that they will see the reason of all this. They didn't tell you that you are 
		their guinea pig and that you'll turn into a unstoppable killer also probably.
		They didn't tell you that there on that Isle, hell awaits....

* Xtra: about playing with bots *

I think it's wisest to start this map with 3 opponents or less,
especially the first time you play it.
In the beginning this level can be very hard with bots, but you'll
see that once you know how to handle the bots you'll mob the floor
with them :P Just find out wich things or locations in the map can be 
used in your advantage ;)
1 example: when ur outta ammo you can easily escape bots by using the
staircases. You'll have to figure the rest out yourself :)
